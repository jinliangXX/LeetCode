There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices.

You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.


总共有n门课，从0到n-1。

有些课程可能有先决条件，例如要选修课程0，你必须先选修课程1，课程1表示为一对:[0,1]

考虑到课程的总数和一组先决条件对，您是否有可能完成所有课程?


注意:

输入的先决条件是由一列边表示的图，而不是邻接矩阵。阅读更多关于如何表示图形的信息。
您可以假设在输入先决条件中没有重复的边。
