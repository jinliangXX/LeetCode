Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Example:

Input:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 6

给定一个仅包含 0 和 1 的二维二进制矩阵，找出只包含 1 的最大矩形，并返回其面积。

示例:

输入:
[
  ["1","0","1","0","0"],
  ["1","0","1","1","1"],
  ["1","1","1","1","1"],
  ["1","0","0","1","0"]
