Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order,
convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem,
a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5


 给定一个数组，其中元素按升序排序，将其转换为高度平衡的BST。

对于这个问题，高度平衡的二叉树被定义为二叉树，
其中每个节点的两个子树的深度从不相差超过1。
