You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount.
Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount.
If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
Example 2:

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.


你会得到不同面值的硬币和总额。写一个函数来计算你需要的最少的硬币数量。
如果那笔钱不能由硬币的任何组合来补足，返回-1。
