Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false,
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].



给定一个嵌套的整数列表，实现一个迭代器将其变平。

每个元素要么是整数，要么是列表——其元素也可以是整数或其他列表。
