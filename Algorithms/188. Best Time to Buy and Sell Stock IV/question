Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time
(ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.




假设您有一个数组，其中第i个元素是第i天给定股票的价格。

设计算法以找到最大利润。 您最多可以完成k笔交易。

注意：
您不得同时进行多笔交易（即，您必须在再次购买之前卖出股票）。
