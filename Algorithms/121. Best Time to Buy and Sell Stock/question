Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction
(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock),
design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


假设您有一个数组，其中第i个元素是第i天给定股票的价格。

如果您只被允许完成最多一笔交易
（即买一个并出售一股股票），
设计一种算法来寻找最大利润。

请注意，在购买之前不能出售股票。
