Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer,
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1


编写一个算法来确定一个数字是否“幸福”。

快乐的数量是一个数字定义为以下过程:从任何正整数,取代数的平方和的位数,
并重复这个过程,直到数= 1(它将保持),或者它无休止地循环周期,不包括1。
这个过程以1结束的那些数字是幸福的数字。
