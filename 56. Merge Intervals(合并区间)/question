Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

给出一个区间的集合，请合并所有重叠的区间。

示例 1:

输入: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
输出: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
解释: 区间 [1,3] 和 [2,6] 重叠, 将它们合并为 [1,6].
示例 2:

输入: [[1,4],[4,5]]
输出: [[1,5]]
解释: 区间 [1,4] 和 [4,5] 可被视为重叠区间。
